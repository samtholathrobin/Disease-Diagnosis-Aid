# Disease-Diagnosis-Aid
This is a model which is a diagnosis aid that can classify 41 diseases from the combinations and selections of 131 different symptoms. 
It can predict diseases that range from fungal infections to AIDS and cancer. This model has been trained to an accuracy of 98.9% which can be considered medical grade. This model was built upon a dataset that had to be thoroughly pre processed. The hardest part of this project was the pre processing of the data because of the initial state of the data.
